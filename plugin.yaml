  AWS SSM parameter injection in Helm value files

  This plugin provides the ability to encode AWS SSM parameter paths into your
  value files to store in version control or just generally less secure places.

  During installation or upgrade, the parameters are replaced with their actual values
  and passed on to Tiller.

  Usage:
  Simply use helm as you would normally, but add 'ssm' before any command,
  the plugin will automatically search for values with the pattern:

      {{ssm /path/to/parameter aws-region}}

  and replace them with their decrypted value.
  Note: You must have IAM access to the parameters you're trying to decrypt, and their KMS key.


  E.g:
  helm ssm install stable/docker-registry --values value-file1.yaml -f value-file2.yaml

  value-file1.yaml:
  ---
  secrets:
    haSharedSecret: {{ssm /mgmt/docker-registry/shared-secret us-east-1}}
    htpasswd: {{ssm /mgmt/docker-registry/htpasswd us-east-1}}
  ---
